# ------------------- Cyberattacks within Connected Vehicles ---------------------------
#
#
# This code package contains various algorithms used to train the model to identify attacks
# Each algorithm can be modified and further fine tuned to eliminate any noise within the data or other hindrances
#
# File being used for app.py is datacleanser.py (main cleanser), with KNN algorithm 
# datacleanser files all contain the data preprocessing, feature selection, and model creation
#
# App.py is run with Streamlit, the chosen model deployment and opens up a site where a user can simulate an attack
# ---> In the future, this interactive attack site will be transformed into a mini car driving simulation where users can see how certain 
# attacks affect the car but also how the algorithm saves the day
